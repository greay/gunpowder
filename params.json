{"name":"Gunpowder: BDD for Unity","body":"![Macaroni is good](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kittypizza/gunpowder.png)\r\n# Gunpowder\r\n\r\nGunpowder is a behaviour-driven development tool for Unity3D that allows you to make the best games, like ever.\r\n\r\n## Pivotal Tracker Project \r\n\r\nhttps://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/456391/\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n5 easy steps:\r\n\r\n1. Import the Gunpowder package into your project\r\n2. In your scene, create an empty game object and call it Spec Runner\r\n3. Create a new javascript file and call it something like MySceneSpec\r\n4. (optional) Copy the code from the template.js file to get started\r\n5. Attach MySceneSpec to your Spec Runner game object\r\n\r\nThat's it!\r\n\r\n## Matchers\r\n\r\nExample: expect(find('object name')).toExist();\r\n\r\n- `toExist()`\r\n- `toBeTruthy()`\r\n- `toBeFalsy()`\r\n- `toEqual(object)`\r\n- `toHavePosition(x, y, z)`\r\n- `toBeVisible()`\r\n- `toBeHidden()`\r\n- `toHaveColor(Color)`\r\n\r\n## Selector Actions\r\n\r\nNote these actions are chainable.\r\n\r\nExample: find('object name').moveTo(1, 1, 1);\r\n\r\n- `moveTo(x, y, z)`\r\n- `mouseEnter(scriptName)`\r\n- `mouseExit(scriptName)`\r\n\r\n## Simulating Input\r\n\r\nNote when using the below methods, you'll have to make sure and use Gunpowder's built in input methods. This is so the test framework can fake user input.\r\n\r\n- `move('forward|backward|left|right', milliseconds, callback)`\r\n  - controls Gunpowder.Input.GetAxis\r\n- `pressButton('Fire1', milliseconds, callback)`\r\n  - controls Gunpowder.Input.GetButton\r\n- `pressKey('a', milliseconds, callback)`\r\n  - controls Gunpowder.Input.GetKey\r\n\r\n## Event Waiting\r\n\r\n- `waits(milliseconds, callback)`\r\n\r\n## Known Limitations :(\r\n\r\n- Can only have one spec file per scene.\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\n\r\nI would love help from anybody since this is my first time creating a testing framework and I know there are people out there MUCH smarter than me! :D Send the ol' pull request and I'll get to it right away. Please include tests though. ;) \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n","tagline":"","google":"UA-30966008-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
